# 𝝵-Guard :: Keycloak plugins

Collection of Keycloak plugins and extensions for 𝝵-Guard

# Required tooling

* Java JDK 21
* Docker
* [ktfmt](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14912-ktfmt) (IntelliJ IDEA plugin)
* `SonarQube for IDE` (IntelliJ IDEA plugin)

# How to build Keycloak

To build the project, run:

```shell
    ./mvnw clean install
```

# How to run Keycloak

To run the application, you can use the following command in the _runtime/_ directory:

```shell
    docker compose up -d
```

and

```shell
    docker compose down -v
```

respectively.

The Keycloak-Frontend should be then available at http://localhost:18080.

# How to run integration tests

For a build including the integration tests, use:

```shell
    ./mvnw clean install -P integration-tests
```

If the integration tests fail to start any containers, try running `docker compose down -v` in the _runtime/_ directory first.

# Formatting and linting

This project relies on [ktfmt](https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt) for formatting Kotlin source
code. It is recommended to install the [ktfmt](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14912-ktfmt) plugin for immediate
correction and feedback while coding.
After installing the plugin, there is a new setting branch under Editor. Enable ktfmt there and select "kotlinlang" as
code style.

ktfmt registers into the IntelliJ Formatter system, so you can continue to use Ctrl-Alt-Shift-l/Cmd-Option-Shift-l, or
use the IDEs auto-save actions,
and so on.

Also, [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven) will format and lint the source code every
time it is built to catch any drift.

## SonarQube

Use [SonarQube for IDE](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-for-ide/intellij/) for additional linting. IntelliJ IDEA
will prompt you to install the plugin if it is missing when you open the project. If you use another supported IDE, you
need to install it manually.

SonarQube is intended to be used
in [connected mode](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-for-ide/intellij/team-features/connected-mode/).
Connected mode will align the Sonar configuration across developer systems and CI pipelines and enable additional
features.
You need to connect to a SonarQube server and bind to a project.

SonarQube is also integrated into the CI pipeline and serves as a quality gate for builds.
Reports can be accessed using links in the individual pipeline logs.
